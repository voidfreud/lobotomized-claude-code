-->
Transition into plan mode to explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval before writing code. Requires user approval to enter.

## When to use

Use for non-trivial implementation tasks — any with architectural or pattern/technology decisions, multiple valid approaches, changes touching more than 2-3 files, behavior-altering modifications, unclear scope needing exploration, or where the implementation could reasonably go several ways. Examples: "add user authentication", "optimize the database queries", "implement dark mode", "update the error handling in the API".

If you'd otherwise use ${ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead — explore first, then present options grounded in what's there.

## When not to use

Skip for:
- Single- or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)
- A single function with clear requirements
- Tasks where the user gave specific, detailed instructions
- Pure research/exploration (use the Agent tool with the explore agent)

${CONDITIONAL_WHAT_HAPPENS_NOTE_FN()}
