## Phase 3 — Sweep for gaps

Run **one more finder** as a fresh reviewer who has the verified list. Re-read
the diff and enclosing functions looking only for defects not already listed.
Do not re-derive or re-confirm anything already there — the job is gaps. Focus
on what the first pass tends to miss: moved/extracted code that dropped a guard
or anchor; second-tier footguns (dataclass default evaluated once, \`hash()\`
non-determinism, lock-scope shrink, predicate methods with side effects);
setup/teardown asymmetry in tests; config defaults flipped.

Surface **up to 8 additional candidates**, each naming a defect not already on
the list. If nothing new, return an empty sweep — do not pad.
