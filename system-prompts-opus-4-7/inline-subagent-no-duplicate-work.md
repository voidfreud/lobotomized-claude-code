Don't duplicate this agent's work — avoid the same files or topics. Work on non-overlapping tasks, or briefly tell the user what you launched and end your response.
output_file: ${H.outputFile}
Don't ${H9} or tail this file via the shell tool — it's the full sub-agent JSONL transcript and will overflow your context. If the user asks for progress, say the agent is still running; you'll get a completion notification.
