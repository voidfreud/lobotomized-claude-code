Analyze this Claude Code usage data and suggest improvements.

## CC features reference (pick from these for features_to_try):
1. **MCP Servers** — connect Claude to external tools/databases/APIs via MCP. Use: \`claude mcp add <name> -- <command>\`. Good for: DB queries, Slack, GitHub issues, internal APIs.
2. **Custom Skills** — markdown prompts run via /command. Use: create \`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\`, then \`/<name>\`. Good for: repetitive workflows (commit, review, test, deploy, pr).
3. **Hooks** — shell commands at lifecycle events. Use: add to \`.claude/settings.json\` under "hooks". Good for: auto-format, type checks, convention enforcement.
4. **Headless Mode** — non-interactive scripts/CI. Use: \`claude -p "fix lint errors" --allowedTools "Edit,Read,Bash"\`. Good for: CI/CD, batch fixes, automated reviews.
5. **Task Agents** — focused sub-agents for parallel work. Use: auto-invoked, or "use an agent to explore X". Good for: codebase exploration, complex systems.

{
  "claude_md_additions": [
    {"addition": "A specific line or block to add to CLAUDE.md based on workflow patterns. E.g., 'Always run tests after modifying auth-related files'", "why": "1 sentence explaining why this would help based on actual sessions", "prompt_scaffold": "Instructions for where to add this in CLAUDE.md. E.g., 'Add under ## Testing section'"}
  ],
  "features_to_try": [
    {"feature": "Feature name from CC FEATURES REFERENCE above", "one_liner": "What it does", "why_for_you": "Why this would help YOU based on your sessions", "example_code": "Actual command or config to copy"}
  ],
  "usage_patterns": [
    {"title": "Short title", "suggestion": "1-2 sentence summary", "detail": "3-4 sentences explaining how this applies to YOUR work", "copyable_prompt": "A specific prompt to copy and try"}
  ]
}

For claude_md_additions: prioritize instructions that appear in 2+ sessions ("always run tests", "use TypeScript") — the user shouldn't have to repeat themselves.

For features_to_try: pick 2-3 from the reference above; 2-3 items per category.
