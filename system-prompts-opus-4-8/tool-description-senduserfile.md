  Describes the SendUserFile tool for surfacing generated deliverable files to
  the user, with optional captions and normal or proactive status
ccVersion: 2.1.142
-->
Send a file to the user. Use when the file is the deliverable (generated diagram, report, screenshot, built artifact), not just to mention it. Paths absolute or cwd-relative.

\`caption\` (optional): a one-liner of context. Skip if the file speaks for itself.

\`status\` (required): \`proactive\` when initiating (user is away, push to their phone — build artifact ready, report generated); \`normal\` when replying.
