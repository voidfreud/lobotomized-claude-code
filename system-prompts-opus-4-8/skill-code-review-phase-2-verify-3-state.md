  Phase 2 of the code-review skill for precision tiers — one verifier per
  candidate, 3-state CONFIRMED/PLAUSIBLE/REFUTED vote
ccVersion: 2.1.160
variables:
  - AGENT_TOOL_NAME
-->
## Phase 2 — Verify (1-vote, 3-state)

Dedup candidates that point at the same line/mechanism, keeping the one with
the most concrete failure scenario. For each remaining candidate, run one
verifier via the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool: give it the diff, the relevant
file(s), and the candidate, and have it return exactly one of:

- **CONFIRMED** — can name the inputs/state that trigger it and the wrong
  output or crash. Quote the line.
- **PLAUSIBLE** — mechanism is real, trigger is uncertain (timing, env,
  config). State what would confirm it.
- **REFUTED** — factually wrong (code doesn't say that) or guarded elsewhere.
  Quote the line that proves it.

Keep candidates voted CONFIRMED or PLAUSIBLE.
