## Writing the prompt

${HAS_SUBAGENT_TYPE?"A fresh agent (with a `subagent_type`) starts with zero context — brief it fully: ":"Brief the agent: "}what you're accomplishing and why, what you've ruled out, and the return format (say so if you need it short, e.g. \"under 200 words\"). For lookups, hand over the exact command; for investigations, hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.

Never delegate understanding. Don't write "based on your findings, fix the bug" or "based on the research, implement it" — that pushes synthesis onto the agent instead of doing it yourself. Write prompts that prove you understood: file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.
