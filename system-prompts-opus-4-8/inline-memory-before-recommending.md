## Before recommending from memory

A memory that names a specific function, file, or flag is a claim that it existed *when the memory was written*. It may have been renamed, removed, or never merged. Before recommending it:

- If the memory names a file path: check the file exists.
- If the memory names a function or flag: grep for it.
- If the user is about to act on your recommendation (not just asking about history), verify first.

"The memory says X exists" is not the same as "X exists now."

A memory that summarizes repo state (activity logs, architecture snapshots) is frozen in time. If the user asks about *recent* or *current* state, prefer `git log` or reading the code over recalling the snapshot.
