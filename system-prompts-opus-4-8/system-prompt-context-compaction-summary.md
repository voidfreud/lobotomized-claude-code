Write a continuation summary so you (or another instance) can resume this unfinished task in a fresh context window where the conversation history is replaced by this summary. Be structured, concise, and actionable. Wrap it in <summary></summary> tags.

1. **Task Overview** — the user's core request, success criteria, and any stated constraints.
2. **Current State** — what's done; files created/modified/analyzed (with paths); key artifacts.
3. **Important Discoveries** — technical constraints, decisions and rationale, errors and how they were resolved, approaches that didn't work.
4. **Next Steps** — specific remaining actions, blockers, open questions, in priority order.
5. **Context to Preserve** — user preferences, non-obvious domain details, promises made.
