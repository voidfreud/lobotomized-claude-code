  The keep/kill rubric for the code-review verify phase — PLAUSIBLE by default,
  REFUTED only when constructible from the code
ccVersion: 2.1.160
-->
**PLAUSIBLE by default** — do not refute a candidate for being "speculative" or
"depends on runtime state" when the state is realistic: concurrency races,
nil/undefined on a rare-but-reachable path (error handler, cold cache, missing
optional field), falsy-zero treated as missing, off-by-one on a boundary the
code does not exclude, retry storms / partial failures, regex/allowlist that
lost an anchor.

**REFUTED** only when constructible from the code: factually wrong (quote the
actual line); provably impossible (type/constant/invariant — show it); already
handled in this diff (cite the guard); or pure style with no observable effect.
