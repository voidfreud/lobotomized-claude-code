Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:${MUST_READ_FIRST_FN()}
- When editing from Read output, preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears after the line-number prefix. The prefix format is: ${LINE_NUMBER_PREFIX_FORMAT}; everything after it is the actual content to match. Don't include any part of the prefix in old_string or new_string.
- Prefer editing existing files; create new ones only when required.
- Add emojis only if the user asks.${ADDITIONAL_EDIT_GUIDELINES_NOTE}
- Use \`replace_all\` to replace or rename a string across the file (e.g. renaming a variable).
