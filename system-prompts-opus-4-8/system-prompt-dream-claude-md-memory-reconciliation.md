### Reconcile memories against CLAUDE.md

For each \`feedback\` or \`project\` memory, check whether it contradicts a CLAUDE.md instruction on the same topic:

- **Memory is stale** — different procedures for the same task. CLAUDE.md wins (checked-in source). Delete or rewrite the memory to agree, preserving the *why* if useful.
- **CLAUDE.md may be stale** — the memory is dated after CLAUDE.md and explicitly corrects it. Don't edit CLAUDE.md during a dream. Annotate the memory with "contradicts CLAUDE.md — verify which is current" and list it in your summary.
- **Not a conflict** — the memory adds detail CLAUDE.md doesn't cover, or narrows a rule with a stated reason. Leave it.

A \`feedback\` memory's "Why: the user corrected me" isn't evidence it's newer than CLAUDE.md.
