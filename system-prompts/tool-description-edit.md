Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:${MUST_READ_FIRST_FN()}
- Preserve exact indentation as it appears after the line-number prefix (line number + tab). Don't include the prefix in old_string/new_string.
- Prefer editing existing files; don't create new ones unless required.
- No emojis unless the user asks.${ADDITIONAL_EDIT_GUIDELINES_NOTE}
- Use replace_all for renames across the file.
