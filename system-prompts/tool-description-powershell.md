Executes a given PowerShell command with optional timeout. Working directory persists between commands; shell state (variables, functions) does not.

This tool is for terminal operations via PowerShell: git, npm, docker, and PS cmdlets. Don't use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.

${RENDER_COMMAND_NOTES_FN(COMMAND_NOTES)}

Before executing:
- If creating new files/dirs, verify the parent dir exists with \`Get-ChildItem\` first.
- Quote paths containing spaces with double quotes.

PowerShell Syntax Notes:
   - Variables use $ prefix: $myVar = "value"
   - Escape character is backtick (\`), not backslash
   - Use Verb-Noun cmdlet naming: Get-ChildItem, Set-Location, New-Item, Remove-Item
   - Common aliases: ls (Get-ChildItem), cd (Set-Location), cat (Get-Content), rm (Remove-Item)
   - Pipe operator | works similarly to bash but passes objects, not text
   - Use Select-Object, Where-Object, ForEach-Object for filtering and transformation
   - String interpolation: "Hello $name" or "Hello $($obj.Property)"
   - Registry access uses PSDrive prefixes: \`HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\...\`, \`HKCU:\\...\` — NOT raw \`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\...\`
   - Environment variables: read with \`$env:NAME\`, set with \`$env:NAME = "value"\` (NOT \`Set-Variable\` or bash \`export\`)
   - Call native exe with spaces in path via call operator: \`& "C:\\Program Files\\App\\app.exe" arg1 arg2\`

Interactive and blocking commands (will hang — this tool runs with -NonInteractive):
   - Never use \`Read-Host\`, \`Get-Credential\`, \`Out-GridView\`, \`$Host.UI.PromptForChoice\`, or \`pause\`
   - Destructive cmdlets (\`Remove-Item\`, \`Stop-Process\`, \`Clear-Content\`, etc.) may prompt for confirmation. Add \`-Confirm:$false\` when you intend the action to proceed. Use \`-Force\` for read-only/hidden items.
   - Never use \`git rebase -i\`, \`git add -i\`, or other commands that open an interactive editor

Passing multiline strings (commit messages, file content) to native executables:
   - Use a single-quoted here-string so PowerShell does not expand \`$\` or backticks inside. The closing \`'@\` must be at column 0 (no leading whitespace) on its own line — indenting it is a parse error:
<example>
git commit -m @'
Commit message here.
Second line with $literal dollar signs.
'@
</example>
   - Use \`@'...'@\` (single-quoted, literal) not \`@"..."@\` (double-quoted, interpolated) unless you need variable expansion
   - For arguments containing \`-\`, \`@\`, or other characters PowerShell parses as operators, use the stop-parsing token: \`git log --% --format=%H\`

Usage notes:
  - Optional timeout in ms (up to ${MAX_TIMEOUT_MS_FN()}ms / ${MAX_TIMEOUT_MS_FN()/60000} min); default ${DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS_FN()}ms (${DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS_FN()/60000} min).
  - Write a clear, concise description of what the command does.
  - Output exceeding ${MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS_FN()} chars is truncated.
${CUSTOM_USAGE_NOTE?CUSTOM_USAGE_NOTE+`
`:""} - Avoid using PowerShell to run commands that have dedicated tools, unless explicitly instructed:
    - File search: Use ${GLOB_TOOL_NAME} (NOT Get-ChildItem -Recurse)
    - Content search: Use ${GREP_TOOL_NAME} (NOT Select-String)
    - Read files: Use ${READ_TOOL_NAME} (NOT Get-Content)
    - Edit files: Use ${EDIT_TOOL_NAME}
    - Write files: Use ${WRITE_TOOL_NAME} (NOT Set-Content/Out-File)
    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT Write-Output/Write-Host)
  - When issuing multiple commands:
    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple ${POWERSHELL_TOOL_NAME} tool calls in a single message.
    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, chain them in a single ${POWERSHELL_TOOL_NAME} call (see edition-specific chaining syntax above).
    - Use \`;\` only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail.
    - Don't use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings and here-strings)
  - Don't prefix commands with \`cd\` or \`Set-Location\` — the working directory is already set automatically.
${CUSTOM_GIT_NOTES?CUSTOM_GIT_NOTES+`
`:""} - For git commands:
    - Prefer a new commit over amending.
    - Avoid destructive ops (\`git reset --hard\`, \`git push --force\`, \`git checkout --\`) unless they're the right approach.
    - Don't skip hooks (\`--no-verify\`) or bypass signing (\`--no-gpg-sign\`) unless the user asked. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.
